      "tips": [
        "Water deeply and less frequently to encourage strong root systems.",
        "Best time to water is early morning to minimize evaporation and fungal growth.",
        "Check soil moisture before watering by inserting your finger 1-2 inches into the soil.",
        "Avoid waterlogging the roots, as it can lead to root rot and oxygen deprivation.",
        "Use a watering can with a fine nozzle for delicate plants to avoid soil erosion.",
        "For succulents and cacti, allow the soil to dry completely between waterings.",
        "Use room-temperature water to avoid shocking the plant's roots.",
        "Water the base of the plant rather than the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.",
        "During rainy seasons, reduce watering frequency to avoid over-saturation.",
        "For seedlings, use a misting spray to keep the soil moist without disturbing the roots.",
        "In winter, reduce watering as plants enter dormancy and require less moisture.",
        "Consider using self-watering pots for consistent moisture levels.",
        "Group plants with similar watering needs together for easier maintenance.",
        "Use a rain barrel to collect and store rainwater for eco-friendly watering.",
        "Monitor plants for signs of underwatering, such as drooping leaves or dry soil.",
        "For plants in clay soil, water less frequently as clay retains moisture longer.",
        "For sandy soil, water more frequently as it drains quickly and dries out faster.",
        "Avoid watering during the hottest part of the day to prevent water loss through evaporation.",
        "Use a moisture meter for precise watering, especially for sensitive plants.",
        "For hanging plants, check drainage holes to ensure excess water can escape."

      "color": "#4CAF50",
      "tips": [
        "Apply NPK fertilizer every 3-4 weeks during the growing season for optimal growth.",
        "Use organic compost to enrich the soil with nutrients and improve its structure.",
        "Monitor leaf color for nutrient deficiencies: yellow leaves (nitrogen), purple edges (phosphorus), brown spots (potassium).",
        "Avoid over-fertilization, which can cause nutrient burn and harm the plant.",
        "Use slow-release granular fertilizers for long-term nutrient availability.",
        "For flowering plants, choose a fertilizer high in phosphorus to promote blooms.",
        "For leafy plants, use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to encourage lush foliage.",
        "Fertilize after watering to prevent root burn and ensure even nutrient distribution.",
        "Test soil pH before fertilizing; most plants prefer a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.",
        "Use foliar sprays for quick nutrient absorption, especially for micronutrients like iron and magnesium.",
        "Incorporate worm castings into the soil for a natural, nutrient-rich boost.",
        "Avoid fertilizing during dormancy or extreme weather conditions.",
        "Use fish emulsion as a natural liquid fertilizer for quick results.",
        "For potted plants, flush the soil occasionally to prevent salt buildup from fertilizers.",
        "Consider using seaweed extract as a natural growth stimulant and stress reliever.",
        "For acid-loving plants like azaleas, use fertilizers specifically formulated for acidic soils.",
        "For vegetables, use a balanced fertilizer to support both foliage and fruit production.",
        "Avoid fertilizing newly transplanted plants until they establish roots.",
        "Use compost tea as a gentle, organic fertilizer for seedlings and young plants.",
        "For orchids, use a specialized orchid fertilizer to meet their unique nutrient needs."

      "tips": [
        "Regularly inspect plants for signs of pests, such as holes in leaves or sticky residue.",
        "Use neem oil as a natural pesticide to deter a wide range of pests.",
        "Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs to control aphids and other pests.",
        "Remove affected leaves or stems immediately to prevent pest spread.",
        "Use insecticidal soap to target soft-bodied pests like spider mites and whiteflies.",
        "Place sticky traps near plants to catch flying insects like fungus gnats.",
        "Maintain plant hygiene by removing dead leaves and debris where pests can hide.",
        "Spray plants with a strong stream of water to dislodge pests like aphids and spider mites.",
        "Use diatomaceous earth around the base of plants to deter crawling insects.",
        "Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, as it can attract pests like aphids.",
        "Rotate crops in the garden to disrupt pest life cycles and reduce infestations.",
        "For severe infestations, use chemical pesticides as a last resort, following label instructions.",
        "Quarantine new plants for a few weeks before introducing them to your garden.",
        "Use companion planting to naturally repel pests; for example, marigolds deter nematodes.",
        "Encourage birds and bats to visit your garden, as they are natural predators of many pests.",
        "For indoor plants, isolate infested plants to prevent pests from spreading.",
        "Use garlic or chili spray as a natural repellent for soft-bodied pests.",
        "For scale insects, use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove them manually.",
        "For caterpillars, handpick them off plants and relocate them away from your garden.",
        "For slugs and snails, use beer traps or copper tape around planters to deter them."
