# üå± PlantTreatmonty: Plant Disease Detection App

PlantTreatmonty is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users identify plant diseases, gain plant care insights, and access a library of common plant diseases. Powered by a **quantized PyTorch model (EfficientNet-B0)**, this app provides fast and accurate plant disease detection without relying on server-based predictions. Additional features include user authentication via Firebase, a plant care tips section, and an extensive disease library for users to explore.

---

## üì± Features

- **Plant Disease Detection**: Quickly identify plant diseases by uploading or capturing plant images. The app uses a **quantized EfficientNet-B0 model** optimized for mobile to provide fast and accurate results.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and signup powered by Firebase.
- **Plant Care Tips**: Discover tips for maintaining healthy plants and preventing disease.
- **Disease Library**: Access a comprehensive library of common plant diseases, including images, symptoms, and treatments.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- Firebase project with Authentication enabled.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Salman-Farid/planty.git
   cd planty
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:

    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project, and enable Firebase Authentication.
    - Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files and place them in the appropriate directories:
        - `android/app/` for `google-services.json`
        - `ios/Runner/` for `GoogleService-Info.plist`

4. Configure Firebase and ML model assets in `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/models/plant_disease_model.pt
   ```

5. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## üî• Technical Details

- **Flutter Framework**: A cross-platform UI toolkit to build the app for both Android and iOS.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user authentication securely.
- **PyTorch (EfficientNet-B0)**: A quantized deep learning model trained for detecting plant diseases. The model is optimized to perform predictions directly on the device for low latency and offline functionality.
- **Dart**: Main programming language used in Flutter development.
